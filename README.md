# obliqueRSF
Oblique random survival forest (ORSFs) are ensembles for right-censured survival data that use linear combinations of input variables to recursively partition a set of training data. Regularized Cox proportional hazard models identify optimal linear combinations of input variables in each recursive partitioning step while building survival trees.
